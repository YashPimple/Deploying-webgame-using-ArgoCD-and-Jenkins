## 🚀 Deploying an open source application using Napptive

Welcome to SharkTanks! an online multiplayer game that allows multiple players to play together over the internet with each other. Even if there is no one around to play, we have implemented a bot that can work as an additional player. This game is open-sourced, so feel free to create issues to add features or fix bugs. If you find the project interesting, please consider giving it a star!

### 💪🏻 Inspiration
We were inspired to build an online multiplayer game because we are fans of video games and the idea of being able to play with others from across the world really excites us.
